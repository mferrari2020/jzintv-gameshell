Release notes for 2020-06-07.  (SVN r1996)
Updates since 2018-12-25.

---------------
 New features:
---------------

*   SDL2 support!  Thanks to Daniele Moglia for nudging me to get this done.
    *   New SDL2-specific keyboard events.  See doc/kbdhackfile.txt.

*   CHEAT support (thanks to Patrick Nadeau).  These allow you to bind keys
    to trigger "pokes" that change values in memory.  This is useful for,
    say, adding lives, becoming invincible, etc.  (TODO: document in
    doc/jzintv/cheat.txt).

*   Other kbdhackfile updates:
    *   Added new pause-related actions:
        *   PAUSE_ON always pauses; PAUSE_OFF always unpauses.
        *   PAUSE_HOLD pauses only while the input key is "down."
            Useful to tie to the HIDE event to auto-pause when minimized.
    *   WINDOW / FULLSC actions:
        *   WINDOW forces windowed mode.  Useful with SDL2 FOCUS_LOST event.
        *   FULLSC forces full-screen mode.
    *   SETMAPx, NEXTMAP, PREVMAP as clearer-named aliases for KBDx/KBDN/KBDP
    *   Added an example kbdhackfile with an alternate ECS keyboard map that's
        more useful on modern computer keyboards.

*   UTF-8 support in game metadata (ROM and BIN+CFG).

*   P macro in .CFG files can now poke paged ROM.

*   Added support for manipulating processor flags to 'g' debugger command.
    Registers numbers 8 - 13 manipulate the flags S, Z, O, C, I, D according to
    the LSB of value.

*   CP-1600X:
    *   Added examples/macro/cp1600x.mac.
    *   Added CP-1600X version of TagAlong Todd 2v.

----------
 Changes:
----------

*   AS1600
    *   Do not sign-extend characters >= 0x80 in STRING/DECLE declarations.
    *   Raise macro expansion limits by 10x.

*   Windows
    *   SDL1: The environment variable SDL_STDIO_REDIRECT controls whether
        jzIntv redirects stdout/stderr to files.  Set it to 0 to send these
        to "stdout.txt", "stderr.txt".
    *   Makefile.stdout is gone.  Use Makefile.w32_sdl1 or Makefile.w32_sdl2
        to build jzIntv.

*   MacOS:
    *   Builds are now 64-bit.
    *   Cmd-F toggles fullscreen/windowed mode.
    *   Cmd-W now closes the program on SDL2.  (Enforced by SDL2.)  Still
        toggles windowed mode on SDL1.

-------------------------
 Cleanups and bug fixes:
-------------------------

*   ROM / BIN handling:
    *   Better .ROM format detection in the presence of metadata tags.
    *   Improved string-quoting rules when generating CFG files.
    *   Use a common unquoter for CFG file parser and everywhere else.

*   Example/library code:
    *   cart.mac: Use EQU, not ORG to declare BYTEVAR/BYTEARRAY.
    *   Add missing library/jlp_accel.asm.
    *   Add macro/cp1600x.mac.

*   jzIntv general:
    *   You can power jzIntv off like an Intellivision II again.
    *   Hack to allow jzIntv SDL1 port to work on OS X Mojave and newer.
    *   Fix INTRQ regression (assert() failure).
    *   Restore JLP accelerator enable state across reset.
    *   Use <stdint.h> types rather than home-grown type aliases.
    *   Lots of type / const / restrict cleanups.
    *   Move color palettes out to their own file, and start to convert
        the rest of jzIntv to use the central infrastructure.
    *   Remove some moribund ports, such as MacOS Classic.
    *   Refactor event subsystem to have a common core, and an SDL-specific
        portion.  EVENT_xx enumeration no longer depends on SDL keycode values.
    *   Re-arm SIGWINCH signal handler in the right place.
    *   Add missing entries to joystick button and hat event tables for
        joysticks 4 through 9.
    *   Fixed some ECS key mappings for certain keys when shift is pressed.
    *   More robust paged-ROM loader in bincfg/legacy.c to handle paged RAM,
        and paged ROM segments that are declared piecemeal.
    *   Begin cleaning up all the global variables and narrowing module
        interfaces.
    *   Clean up stray debug printfs in bincfg_lexer ("BAD2", "BAD3").
    *   More MSVC compatibility fixes.
    *   Correctly map between voice/voice_compat in CFG metadata.
    *   Remove unnecessary uses of 'volatile'.

*   JzIntv debugger:
    *   Pokes to paged-ROMs now work correctly.
    *   Fix cycle skid on reaching a HLT instruction.

*   jzIntv CPU instruction decode cache invalidation fixes:
    *   Invalidate 2K of address space on Intellicart bankswitch.
    *   Invalidate paged-ROM flips correctly.

*   Minor bugfix encoding LUIGI files with paged memory that overlaps JLP
    accelerator memory.

-------
 Misc:
-------
*   Updated Emscripten to build with either SDL1 or SDL2.  Untested.
